A simple Rust application that generates BIP39 mnemonic phrases and derives a seed from them. This project utilizes the `bip39` crate to create secure, random mnemonics suitable for cryptographic applications.

## Features

- Generate random BIP39 mnemonic phrases (12, 15, 18, 21, or 24 words).
- Derive a seed from the generated mnemonic.
- Print the mnemonic and the seed in hexadecimal format.
